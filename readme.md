## Library Management System(SE)

## Summary:

The LibraryManagementAPI is a powerful backend application built to streamline library operations using the Spring Boot framework. This API serves as the backbone for a comprehensive Library Management System, offering a robust set of features to efficiently handle book inventory, user management, and transactional processes. With a focus on simplicity and scalability, this API is designed to enhance the overall management of library resources.

## Features:

### 1. Book Inventory Management:

- Add, update, and delete books from the library inventory.
- Track book details such as title, author, genre, and availability status.

### 2. User and Checkout Record Management:

- Manage user accounts

### 3. Transaction Handling:

- Facilitate check-in and check-out processes for books.
- Keep a transaction history for monitoring user activity.

### 4. Scalability:

- Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate a growing library collection.
- Optimize performance for handling a large number of concurrent transactions.

## Technologies Used:

### 1. Spring Boot:

- Framework for creating robust and scalable Java-based applications.

### 2. Java:

- Core programming language for building the backend logic.

### 3. Spring Data JPA:

- Simplifies database access using the Java Persistence API (JPA).

### 5. Hibernate:

- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for data handling.

### 6. RESTful API Design:

- Utilizes REST principles for a clear and consistent API structure.
